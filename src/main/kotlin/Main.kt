//It has these functions:
//- carry(people: Int) : Prints out “Carrying $people passengers” if the

//by $x people” where x is the number of people exceeding its capacity
//(3 points)
//- identity() : Prints out the color, make and model in the following
//format e.g: “I am a white subaru legacy” (1 point)
//- calculateParkingFees(hours: Int) : Calculates and returns the
//parking fees by multiplying the hours by 20 (1 point)
//
//2. Create a class Bus with the same attributes and functions as the Car class.
//In addition, it has another method called maxTripFare(fare: Double) that
//calculates and returns the maximum amount of fare that can be collected per
//trip. (2 points)
//The bus’ calculateParkingFees method returns the product of hours and
//the capacity of the bus (3 points)

//Make use of inheritance to avoid duplication. Also be sure to instantiate both classes
//and call each of the functions on the objects.
